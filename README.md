# mixxx-launchpad-mini
Novation Launchpad Mini mapping for Mixxx based on marczis and zestoi's work
This is only an alternative layout that only support two decks.

# Installation
To install clone the repository or download the zip file and follow [these](https://www.mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/controlling_mixxx.html#installing-a-preset-from-the-forum) instructions.

# User Guide
I mapped this to work with pages (there are two pages empty that I use to controll lights with [qlcplus](https://www.qlcplus.org/)).
This is how I use Mixxx:


I always use the same four effects because I mapped some of their parameters in Launchpad.
